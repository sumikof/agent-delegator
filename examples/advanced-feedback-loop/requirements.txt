# Sample Requirements for Advanced Feedback Loop Example

## Project Overview
Build a modern web application with the following features:

### Core Features
1. User authentication system (JWT-based)
2. RESTful API backend with Python
3. React-based frontend with responsive design
4. Database integration (SQLite for development)
5. Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Technical Requirements
1. Backend:
   - Python 3.10+
   - FastAPI framework
   - SQLAlchemy for ORM
   - Pydantic for data validation
   - JWT authentication
   - Comprehensive API documentation (OpenAPI)

2. Frontend:
   - React 18+
   - TypeScript
   - Material-UI for components
   - React Router for navigation
   - Axios for API calls

3. Quality Requirements:
   - Test coverage >= 85%
   - Code quality score >= 0.9 (using standard linters)
   - Documentation coverage >= 90%
   - Performance: API response time < 500ms
   - Security: OWASP Top 10 compliance

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. Performance:
   - Backend: Handle 100 concurrent requests
   - Frontend: Load time < 2 seconds
   - Database: Response time < 100ms for queries

2. Security:
   - Input validation on all API endpoints
   - CSRF protection
   - Rate limiting (100 requests/minute per IP)
   - Secure password storage (bcrypt)

3. Scalability:
   - Containerized deployment (Docker)
   - Horizontal scaling capability
   - Stateless backend services

4. Monitoring:
   - Comprehensive logging
   - Health check endpoints
   - Performance metrics collection

### Delivery Requirements
1. Complete API specification (OpenAPI 3.0)
2. Backend source code with tests
3. Frontend source code with tests
4. Docker configuration files
5. Deployment documentation
6. User manual
7. Test reports and quality metrics
